A team of 6 set out to create a competitor to Uber Eats for our degree's [capstone project](https://courses.uow.edu.au/subjects/2022/CSIT321). This year long project enabled us to simulate the system development process in a real-world environment. Weekly meetings were held, tasks were allocated, deadlines were set, and we ended up placing highly in the [tradeshow (group 10)](https://www.uow.edu.au/engineering-information-sciences/tradeshow/) where we were judged against all projects created from our cohort.
