# WhatsForDinner
A link to the project that my team has chosen to create for our university capstone project. We set out to create an application meant to compete with existing food service apps (i.e. uber eats) by providing delivery, ordering, and reservation functions. We wanted to learn git functionalities for this project so that we could familiarize ourselves for any future work opportunities
