# WhatsForDinner
A link to the project that my team has chosen to create for our university capstone project. We set out to create an application meant to compete with existing food service apps (i.e. uber eats) by providing delivery, ordering, and reservation functions. React was decided upon for the development of the website as we decided it would be a useful learning experience for any work in the future. We also made sure to learn how to use git repositories for this project aswell.
